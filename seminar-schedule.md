   should compromise among themselves in advance. The seminar will not extend beyond 13:00.
2. Prepare well-structured slides with solid supporting materials.
3. The presentation must begin with a review of the TODO list from the last presentation. It should
   contain the progress of each item and plans for unfinished ones.
4. Prepare the presentation meticulously! The presentation will be terminated in the following cases.
   - **Three** basic errors are found in the materials, e.g., typos, grammatical errors, obvious
     mathematical/logical mistakes.
   - The speaker fails to answer **three** basic questions, e.g., on undergraduate-level mathematics,
     motivation or implication of the work, basic tools used.
   Let AI assist you with the preparation! **Include this rule on your first slide.**
